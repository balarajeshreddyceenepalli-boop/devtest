  # Fix RLS Policies for Admin Operations

  1. Security Updates
    - Add INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies for admin operations
    - Allow anonymous access for admin operations (temporary solution)
    - Add policies for all admin-managed tables

  2. Tables Updated
    - categories: Allow full CRUD for anon users
    - subcategories: Allow full CRUD for anon users  
    - products: Allow full CRUD for anon users
    - product_flavors: Allow full CRUD for anon users
    - promotions: Allow full CRUD for anon users
    - coupons: Allow full CRUD for anon users
    - stores: Allow full CRUD for anon users

  Note: In production, replace 'anon' with proper admin authentication
